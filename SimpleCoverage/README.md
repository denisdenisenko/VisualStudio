# Simple Code Coverage Analyzer

A lightweight Visual Studio extension that displays code coverage metrics for MSTest projects.

## Features

- Displays code coverage metrics from MSTest projects
- Automatically detects and parses coverage files
- Shows coverage percentages with color coding (green for good coverage, red for poor coverage)
- Simple, non-intrusive UI with minimal dependencies
- Focuses exclusively on MSTest coverage (not xUnit)

## Usage

1. Install the extension in Visual Studio
2. Run your MSTest tests with coverage collection:
   ```
   dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MSTest" --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
   ```
3. In Visual Studio, open the "MSTest Coverage" window (View > Other Windows > MSTest Coverage)
4. The coverage metrics will be displayed automatically
5. Click "Refresh Coverage" to update the display after running tests again

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET projects using MSTest for unit testing
- Coverlet for coverage collection (included with the .NET SDK)

## Building from Source

1. Clone this repository
2. Open SimpleCoverage.sln in Visual Studio
3. Build the solution
4. The VSIX extension package will be created in the bin/Debug or bin/Release folder

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you have MSTest projects in your solution
2. Verify that coverage data is being generated by running tests with the `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` flag
3. Check the Visual Studio activity log for any extension loading errors
4. Try restarting Visual Studio after installing the extension
